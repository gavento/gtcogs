# GT Cogs

Sketch of a [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory) framework and API in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

This repo is currently purely experimental. I started it as an exploration* of the right API for game theory
framework in Rust to be subsequently reimplemented similarly in [GameGym](https://github.com/gavento/gamegym).
It *could* be a base of a GT lib in Rust but currently there are no plans in this direction.

*) Have you also noticed that drafting APIs in a very strict language forces you to think through some
decisions you would notice only much later in e.g. Python?
